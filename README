The game rule is simple,eat ten dots to level up.
You have only three chances.Every time you collide with the obstacle,you loss a chance.
What's interest is the distance between obstacles
narrows when level up,however,there is no increment on your chances.It's hard to reach
level ten within three chances.So i play the game for trainning my patience,attentions,and
reaction.

There exists some problems.
First,the maps don't adjust to screen size.So you may
play the game either more easily or more difficultly.
Secondly,if you press UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT and
don't release,you may not move forward.
Last but deadily,may not generate dots which means you will never level up.

As for the codes,it makes me reflect on these aspects:
magic number: contributes to more readable codes;
macro substitution: shorten codes;
function seperation: make codes logical and easy to maintain.
Thus,i remain the codes unchanged.
